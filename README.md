# Google Search History Analyzer
I wrote a quick script to look at different details of Google search histroy

# How to use
1. Download your google search history from [google takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).
2. If you don't have [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) install it.
3. Run the script with python3, giving it the directory of the folder containing your google search .json dumps. Use `-f` to draw plots on their own figures.

# Dependencies
Current dependencies include:
- matplotlib
- numpy

### A note
Early commits refer to files in a directory, because this project was originally part of my [quick and dirty repo](https://github.com/kurtlewis/quickanddirty).
